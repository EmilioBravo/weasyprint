A simple Laravel 7.x/8.x wrapper for the [WeasyPrint Document Factory](https://weasyprint.org/).

## Installation

First make sure WeasyPrint is [installed on your system](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Then install the package with Composer:

```shell
$ composer require rockett/weasyprint
```

The package will be discovered and registered automatically.

## Usage

```php
use WeasyPrint\WeasyPrint;
```

### Input

```php
// Pass in a renderable, some text, or a URL â€¦
$weasyprint = WeasyPrint::make(view('report'));
$weasyprint = WeasyPrint::make('Hello!');
$weasyprint = WeasyPrint::make('https://weasyprint.org');

// Or the name of a view â€¦
$weasyprint = WeasyPrint::view('report');

// Perhaps some big data?
$weasyprint = WeasyPrint::view('report', [
  'bigData' => $this->getBigData()
]);
```

### Output

```php
// Render the file and get the data â€¦
return $weasyprint->toPdf();
return $weasyprint->toPng();

// How about a direct download / inline render? (extension determines file type)
return $weasyprint->download('report.pdf');
return $weasyprint->inline('report.png');
```

### Other Options

```php
// Set a base URL for links â€¦
$weasyprint->setBaseUrl('https://example.com/resources');

// Add a stylesheet â€¦
$weasyprint->addStylesheet('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap')

// Less common, but handy when you need them â€¦
$weasyprint->setResolution($resolution);
$weasyprint->setMediaType($mediaType);
$weasyprint->setPresentationalHints(true);
$weasyprint->addAttachment('/path/to/file');
```

## Config

If you'd like to change the path to the WeasyPrint binary or set the default cache prefix and process timeout, you can publish the config file and make adjustments accordingly.

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=weasyprint-config
```

This is the default configuration:

```php
return [
  'binary' => '/usr/local/bin/weasyprint',
  'cache_prefix' => 'weasyprint-cache_',
  'timeout' => 3600,
];
```
